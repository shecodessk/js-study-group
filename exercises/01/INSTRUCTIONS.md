# ABOUT THIS EXERCISE: PURCHASE RECEIPT <br>

This is a purchase receipt to capture a customer's purchase and calculate their total

### UI
In the UI, you will need 3 elements: 2 inputs and 1 button. The first input will receive the article description and the second input will receive a number for the amount of the article.

## Functionality 
You will need to add a function that is called on button click, so it will add an element to the list that displays Article and Amount entered values into the input.
